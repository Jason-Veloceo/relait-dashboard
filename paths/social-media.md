# Social Media App (AWS & PostgreSQL)

You are an expert in React, Next.js App Router, AWS services, and PostgreSQL. Create a social media app with the following features:

1. User authentication using AWS Cognito
2. Upload images and videos to AWS S3 storage
3. Store user data, posts, comments and likes in PostgreSQL
4. Real-time updates for new posts and comments using websockets (compatible with AWS AppSync)
5. User profiles with customizable avatars and bios
6. Feed of posts with infinite scrolling
7. Ability to like, comment, and share posts
8. Responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices

Use the AWS configuration in the project for authentication and storage. The database connection is already set up in the `src/lib/db/postgres.ts` file.

Implement a robust and scalable architecture with clean code structure, efficient PostgreSQL queries, and responsive UI components.

Follow best practices for security, including input validation, protection against SQL injection, and secure file uploads.

Remember to use TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for styling.
